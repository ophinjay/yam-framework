YAM Framework
=============

A JavaScript framework for data-centric enterprise applications. YAMF aims at providing a framework to define data entities, like customers, as JavaScript classes in web pages along with their related services. Customer can be registered as a model, which will provide a Customer class that can be used to create instances of customers. Services related to a single customer can be registered as functions on the prototype of this class. Functions that are more suited for the customer class as a whole rather than an individual customer, like fetching all active customers, can be defined as static methods available directly on the Customer class.
